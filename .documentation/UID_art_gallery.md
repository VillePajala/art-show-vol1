# User Interface Design Document

## Layout Structure
- Initial landing page with centered title and a brief description of the exhibition
- “Enter Exhibition” button transitions to the gallery view
- Gallery view presented as a vertical linear list of artworks (like a dark hallway)
- Each artwork is accessed individually, like entering separate rooms or scenes
- Fullscreen mode for each artwork with a minimal UI overlay

## Core Components
- **Landing Screen:** Title, brief concept description, and call-to-action button
- **Gallery List:** Titles or thumbnails representing each piece, listed vertically
- **Artwork Viewer:** Fullscreen live-rendered code art with hidden or minimal description
- **Description Overlay:** A minimal placard-style element in the bottom-left corner
- **Navigation Arrows:** “Previous” and “Next” buttons to switch between pieces
- **Return Control:** Escape or a button to go back to the gallery list

## Interaction patterns
- “Enter Exhibition” initiates smooth transition into gallery mode
- Hover effects or subtle animation on gallery items
- Clicking a piece triggers a curtain-style animation to reveal artwork fullscreen
- Artworks can be interacted with (e.g., mouse input or keyboard depending on the piece)
- Minimal hover hint for interactivity when applicable
- Description can be toggled or shown after a delay to avoid disrupting immersion

## Visual Design Elements & Color Scheme
- Background: Deep black or near-black for high contrast
- Typography: Light gray or white for text, possibly with subtle animations or fade-ins
- Transitions: Smooth and theatrical — fade-ins, curtain-like reveals, slide transitions
- Elements: Very minimal UI chrome to maintain focus on the artwork

## Mobile, Web App, Desktop considerations
- Fully responsive design using a flexible layout system
- Touch input support for mobile interactions
- Adaptive fullscreen handling across devices
- Layout shifts from vertical list on desktop to swipeable sections on mobile

## Typography
- Headings: Elegant serif font for titles and intro text
- Body: Clean sans-serif font for descriptions and UI
- Contrast: High contrast with enough spacing and size for readability

## Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation supported (e.g., arrow keys, Enter, Escape)
- Text elements use sufficient contrast for readability
- Artwork descriptions use semantic HTML elements where applicable
- ARIA labels for interactive components (e.g., navigation buttons)
